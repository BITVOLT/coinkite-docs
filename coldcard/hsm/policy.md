## HSM Policy

The HSM policy is established by a simple JSON file, which states
the rules for which spending transactions should be signed automatically
by the Coldcard. It is uploaded to the Coldcard, which renders
summary of the policy for you to approve on-screen.

The file has two parts: global settings and a variable number of "rules".
