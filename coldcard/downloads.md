# Electrum Wallet for Coldcard

Please visit the main [Electrum site](https://electrum.org/#download)
to get version 3.2.3 or later, which now supports Coldcard out of
the box.  To use Coldcard in a multisig wallet with Electrum, you
will need version 4.0.0 or higher.

We strongly recommend you personally verify the GPG signatures that
are shared on that page. It's important to trust the source of your
desktop wallet software.


# Coldcard Firmware

Please visit [this page](upgrade) for the latest firmware for the Coldcard itself,
and how to upgrade.
